1. Convert a Boolean to a String: 
   Implement a function which convert the given boolean value into its string representation.
   Note: Only valid inputs will be given.

2. Grasshopper - Function syntax debugging:
   A student was working on a function and made some syntax mistakes while coding. Help them find their mistakes and fix them.

3. If/else syntax debug:
   While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to create a function to check if the user is still 
   alive called checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive. Unfortunately, Greg made some errors while creating the function.

   checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive should return true if the player's health is greater than 0 or false if it is 
   0 or below. The function receives one parameter health which will always be a whole number between -10 and 10.

4. Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome.

5. Find the mean (average) of a list of numbers in an array:

   Information
   To find the mean (average) of a set of numbers add all of the numbers together and divide by the number of values in the list.

   For an example list of 1, 3, 5, 7

   a. Add all of the numbers (1+3+5+7 = 16)
   b. Divide by the number of values in the list. In this example there are 4 numbers in the list. (16/4 = 4)
   c. The mean (or average) of this list is 4

6. In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

   Examples
   makeNegative(1);    // return -1
   makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
   makeNegative(0);    // return 0
   makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
  
   Notes
   The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
   Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

7. The two oldest ages function/method needs to be completed. It should take an array of numbers as its argument and return 
   the two highest numbers within the array. The returned value should be an array in the format [second oldest age, oldest age].

   The order of the numbers passed in could be any order. The array will always include at least 2 items. If there are two or 
   more oldest age, then return both of them in array format.

   For example:
   twoOldestAges( [1, 2, 10, 8] ) // should return [8, 10]

8. In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with 
   the strings filtered out.

  Example
  filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
  filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
  filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]
