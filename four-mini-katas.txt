1. Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user. However, she's in love 
with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different. She added a special case to 
her function, but she made a mistake.

Can you help her?

2. The code provided is supposed replace all the dots (.) in the specified String str with dashes (-)
But it's not working properly.

Task
Fix the bug so we can all go home early.

Notes
String str will never be null.

3. Convert number to reversed array of digits
Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.

4. Triple Trouble
Create a function that will return a string that combines all of the letters of the three inputed strings in groups.
Taking the first letter of all of the inputs and grouping them next to each other. Do this for every letter, see example below!

E.g. Input: "aa", "bb" , "cc" => Output: "abcabc"

Note: You can expect all of the inputs to be the same length.
